# CAPSTONE PROJECT
## Problem Statement:
In Washington, D.C., crime prevention and community safety have been ongoing priorities. However, effectively addressing these issues requires a comprehensive understanding of crime patterns, including crime frequency, geographical hotspots, trends over time, and severity levels.
## The Challenge:
Use Power BI, to analyze and visualize crime data in a way that offers actionable insights. These insights will support law enforcement, policymakers, and the public in making data-driven decisions to improve safety, allocate resources efficiently, and develop targeted crime prevention strategies across the city.

## KPIs:
Total Crimes Reported â€“ Number of crimes committed in a given time period.
Crimes by Time of Day â€“ Distribution of crimes by shift (Midnight, Day, Evening).
Top 5 Crime Types â€“ Most frequently occurring offenses.
Crime Severity Index â€“ Weighting crimes based on UCR ranking to assess overall risk.
Crime by Neighbourhood â€“ Number of reported crimes per neighbourhood cluster.
Hotspot Analysis â€“ Geographical visualization of crime density.
Weapon-Related Crimes â€“ Percentage of crimes involving firearms.
Time to Resolution â€“ Average duration from crime occurrence to report filing.
Trends Over Time â€“ Year-over-year or month-over-month crime trends.
Crime Rate by Police District â€“ Total crimes per district to assess law enforcement efficiency.
## Findings
Majority of crimes are non-violent thefts occurring in evening hours.

Crimes cluster in specific neighborhoods and blocks, enabling targeted policing.

Weapon-related and violent crimes are comparatively low.

Crime severity is moderate, but certain neighborhoods exhibit consistently high crime frequency.

Time-of-day and geographic data provide actionable insights for resource deployment and community engagement.
## Final Conclusion: Washington DC Crime Analysis
The crime landscape in Washington DC, based on the analyzed period, reveals that property crimes dominate the offense profile, with theft-related incidents accounting for the majority. Evening hours show the highest crime rates, suggesting a need for increased surveillance and law enforcement presence during this time.
Criminal activity is geographically concentrated, with specific neighborhood clusters and blocks consistently reporting high numbers of incidentsâ€”particularly Cluster 2 and the 3100â€“3299 block of 14th Street NW. These areas represent critical hotspots requiring strategic intervention.
While violent and weapon-related crimes are less frequent, they contribute significantly to the overall crime severity, warranting continued attention. The average severity index of 6.33 reflects a moderate risk level, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a balance between reactive law enforcement and proactive community engagement.
In summary, crime prevention efforts should focus on:
Targeted policing in high-crime neighborhoods and blocks

Enhanced evening patrols

Community programs to deter theft-related crimes

Data-driven resource allocation across time and geography
