# CAPSTONE PROJECT
## Problem Statement:
In Washington, D.C., crime prevention and community safety have been ongoing priorities. However, effectively addressing these issues requires a comprehensive understanding of crime patterns, including crime frequency, geographical hotspots, trends over time, and severity levels.
## The Challenge:
Use Power BI, to analyze and visualize crime data in a way that offers actionable insights. These insights will support law enforcement, policymakers, and the public in making data-driven decisions to improve safety, allocate resources efficiently, and develop targeted crime prevention strategies across the city.
